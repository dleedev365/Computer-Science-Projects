# Purpose
To develop an application corresponding to its tittle dervied from acronyms such as SFU, CSSS, LISP, LEAF, GO and ASCII

# Problem Statement
It is well-kwown among Vancouverites that booking a knowledge test at ICBC is really challenging. Even a less-populated and remote place like Kamloops has most of their appointments fully booked till next year. Even more, it's really cumbersome to check the next available date by manually going through a calender. To solve this problem, we aimed to automate ICBC booking process. 

# Technology
 - Selenium for testing
 - Python for scripting
 
# To run the program
1. source virtual-env/bin/activate
2. python3 python_org_search.py

# Case Studies
- The current version of the program is given a set of pre-defined options to fill an appointment form. To make the program more robust, it is highly recommended to design a GUI or website-like form for users to select their preferences of services, dates and etc.
